### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on [Emmy](https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy), a computer algebra system in Clojure that's designed for explorations in symbolic math, classical mechanics and differential geometry.

This effort is a push toward a larger goal of a [Dynamic Notebook](https://roadtoreality.substack.com/p/the-dynamic-notebook), a sort of "Executable Wikipedia". What if publishing interactive, executable models was as easy as publishing an essay on some topic?

If this is intriguing, you can support the work at my [Github Sponsors dashboard](https://github.com/sponsors/sritchie). All contributions go into a pool that I'll use to pay contributors for help with literate essays and executable textbook contributions that can help with and spread this work.

I write about this mission at the [Road to Reality newsletter](https://roadtoreality.substack.com). Please subscribe, and sponsor this work if you find it inspiring or compelling!
